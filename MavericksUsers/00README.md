Swift 1.2 requires that you run at least Xcode 6.3 on OS X 10.10 Yosemite.

I've just updated the book to this current release but I understand that some readers won't have Yosemite or Xcode 6.3 installed.

These files are no longer maintained. I don't know if they will continue to work and they may not match what is said in the book anymore. I did, however want to support those of you who are unable or unwilling to update to the latest version of the developer tools and operating system.
